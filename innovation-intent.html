          <h2>Early Stockist Advantage: Smart AI Website Scraper &amp; Interactive Website Assistant</h2>
          <p>
            Note: As soon as the AI web scraper is fully implemented on SpiritBrew, it will be made available to all early stockists.

            At SpiritBrew, we’re pioneering innovation that benefits not only our brand but also our valued stockists.
            Our AI-powered website scraper is designed to be integrated directly into your website as a conversational assistant —
            a friendly floating widget that answers visitor questions in real time by scanning your entire website
            and connected inventory documents (like Google Drive files).
          </p>
          <p>
            This AI assistant lets your customers explore and ask about your business using the information you choose to share —
            whether that’s product details, services, or other helpful background stored documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a conversational guide that enhances transparency and customer engagement without needing extra staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, this technology will evolve into a fully dynamic inventory interface — syncing with your stock database
            to provide accurate, live updates on product availability.
            Imagine customers checking your site and instantly knowing whether SpiritBrew or other favorites are in stock
            or when they’ll be back on the shelves.
          </p>
