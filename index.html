              SpiritBrew is a new category of RTD coffee — Luxium.
              Inspired by the taste and warm sophistication of spirits — minus the alcohol (for now).
              Designed for grown-up moments, day or night.

          <h2>What is Spirit Brew?</h2>
          <p>
            SpiritBrew is a new take on coffee — rooted in craftsmanship, inspired by spirits, and designed for grown-up tastes.
            At its core, Spirit Brew brings together two rituals: the contemplative depth of luxury cold brew,
            and the rich complexity of premium spirits. We reimagine these familiar flavours — not to replicate alcohol,
            but to honour its warmth, sophistication, and cultural presence. All without the hangover.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is coffee designed to be sipped, not rushed. Luxium flavour with presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spirit Brew is for those who want more from a drink — bold flavour, conscious choices, and a little moment of refinement,
            whether it’s 11am or 11pm.
          </p>

          <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
          <p>
            Expanding the Non-Alcoholic Range
          </p>
          <p>
            Our flagship, WhisCoffee — an alcohol-free Irish coffee-inspired coldbrew — leads the way in delivering rich,
            sophisticated flavors without the spirits. We’re excited to develop more non-alcoholic variations in the future,
            bringing even more choices for those who enjoy bold, crafted coffee experiences without alcohol.
