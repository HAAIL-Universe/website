          <h2 class="section-heading">Spiced Brandy — A Winter Coffee Ritual</h2>
          <p class="section-lead">
            Built for evenings, not inboxes. Spiced Brandy is the first full SpiritBrew release to step out of the kitchen and onto shelves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expect deep roast, not burnt bitterness. Spice that feels like a slow exhale, not a firework.
            A brandy note that complements the coffee instead of drowning it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed for winter menus, gifting, and “one more drink” moments.</li>
            <li>Balanced so it can be enjoyed straight from the can or poured over ice.</li>
            <li>Refined through dozens of micro-batches, real-world testing, and honest feedback.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            “It tastes like an Irish coffee and a Christmas market decided to slow down and talk.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Early tastings have made one thing clear: when people can choose, they gravitate toward the
            **alcoholic** versions. So Spiced Brandy now leads the SpiritBrew lineup, with future non-alcoholic
            variants waiting in the wings for a dedicated release.

            SpiritBrew started as one bottle on a kitchen counter. It turned into a roadmap.
            Spiced Brandy is first out of the gate — but it isn’t the only idea in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are working concepts and in-development flavours.
            They’re not all on shelves yet, but they shape where the brand is headed.

              Dark-roast coffee, oak-warmed brandy character, cinnamon, clove and soft vanilla.
              Built to feel like a fireside drink in a can — slow, grown-up, and unapologetically bold.

            SpiritBrew is intentionally small — one founder, one kitchen, one obsessive roadmap. That means early stockists get more than a product line.

            <li>Distinctive, story-driven drink that actually has something to say on the shelf.</li>

            The aim isn’t to flood every shelf. It’s to partner with places where story, selection and taste actually matter.
